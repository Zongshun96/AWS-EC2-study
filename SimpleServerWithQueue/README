Problem/TODO:
    health check interval

Issues:
    extra latency for SQS services / classic load balancer surge queue
        seems not severe. the previous high latency was probably because my polling server was working sequentially(my stupid)

Done:
    register target without auto scaling running.
        instead of mannually run new instance, we decided to change the quota in AutoScaling and let it to keep the number of VM's stable at that value
        So that load balancer can handle traffic drain instead of implement it myself.
        aws cli command
            aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name "fixed number of running VMs" --min-size 10 --max-size 10
